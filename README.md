# Deep_Multi_Modal_Autoencoder

The code used for the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing 2019 submission

This code is used for performing feature set pre-processing such as to indentify and replace missing data with special values (-1) and the training and validation of the deep autoencoder. As described in the main manuscript, all source-wise missing data has been simulated therefore additional code is provided which is used to assess the reconstruction error of the autoencoder.

Please contact john.prince@eng.ox.ac.uk for any questions regarding the code or the manuscript.

Code Includes:

1) main.py

2) featurePreparation.py

3) deepAutocoder.py

4) reconstructionError.py

UPDATE: Code is currently being formatted into publishable form and will be uploaded soon.
